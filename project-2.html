    <h3>Title - text and font</h3>
    <p><span class="score">Score: -2</span> — It uses a bold, impactful font and directly communicates the opinion being presented through the data visualization. Using a stronger font sends a deeper message with the connotation of delivering important information. The use of three terms in the title is a linguistic persuasive technique that helps engage the audience. Starting with the words <strong>discourtesy</strong> and <strong>force</strong> familiarises readers with the issues people face against police officer misconduct thus providing a push into the topic of the graph.</p>
  
    <h3>Colour</h3>
    <p><span class="score">Score: -1.5</span> — The colour adds to the overall mood and theme of the graph. A red colour connoting blood and violence is accurate in the bias of this display. In addition to the justification of the red theme, using a gradient that blends from one colour to the next at the point of the jump in the curve of the line graph emphasises the trends I want to highlight. Making the colours darker as time moves forward implies a worsening situation. Using a colour gradient under the line graph also amplified the area under the graph, making the portion seem more relevant.</p>
  
    <h3>Time frame</h3>
    <p><span class="score">Score: -1.5</span> — Conveniently using a timeframe that represents the opinion is one of the most important parts of the visualization. The time frame crops out the last 2 years of data where the graph gradually reduces to persuade the audience of the argument presented.</p>
  
    <h3>Logo</h3>
    <p><span class="score">Score: -0.5</span> — Using a non-coloured, shield-shaped logo aligns with the overall theme. Since it isn’t the most commonly seen version of the logo, this reinforces the power of the police and the authority that comes with being an NYPD officer. Logos are known to increase credibility in persuasive images.</p>

    <h3>Title - text and font</h3>
    <p><span class="score">Score: -2</span> — It uses a softer, inviting font and directly communicates the opinion being presented through the data visualization. Using a curlier font sends a lighter message, suggesting positive news. The use of the NYPD’s beloved nickname in the title is a linguistic persuasive technique that helps engage the audience, giving them something to relate to and reminding them of a popular phrase they most likely enjoy.</p>
  
    <h3>Colour</h3>
    <p><span class="score">Score: -1.5</span> — The calm blue colour connotes peace and improvement. A gradient that blends colours at the point of a curve jump helps highlight key trends. Colours lighten as time moves forward to imply progress. The gradient under the graph amplifies the area and makes the lighter section seem lower than it is.</p>
  
    <h3>Time frame</h3>
    <p><span class="score">Score: -2</span> — The time frame includes years before complaints were regularly taken from Black people, creating a false impression of long-term improvement. This selection supports the idea that racially charged misconduct has reduced since then, but the framing omits crucial context.</p>
  
    <h3>Logo</h3>
    <p><span class="score">Score: 1</span> — Using a familiar, blue-coloured logo with the shield on the side enhances the theme of familiarity. It reinforces the more positive public image of the police.</p>
