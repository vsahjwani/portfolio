        Title - text and font
        I’d score this a -2 as it uses a bold, impactful font and directly communicates the opinion being presented through the data visualization. 
        Using a stronger font sends a deeper message with the connotation of delivering important information. The use of three terms in the title is a linguistic persuasive technique that helps engage the audience. Starting with the words discourtesy and force familiarises readers with the issues people face against police officer misconduct thus providing a push into the topic of the graph.
        Colour
        The colour adds to the overall mood and theme of the graph thus a red colour connoting blood and violence is accurate in the bias of this display thus I’d score it a -1.5.
        In addition to the justification of the red theme, using a gradient that blends from one colour to the next at the point of the jump in the curve of the line graph emphasises the trends I want to highlight. Along with this I decided to make the colours darker as time moved forward to imply a situation worsening. Using a colour gradient under the line graph also amplified the area under the graph, making the portion seem more relevant.
        Time frame
        Conveniently using a timeframe that represents the opinion is one of the most important parts of the visualization therefore I’d score it with a -1.5 too.
        The time frame crops out the last 2 years of data where the graph gradually reduces to persuade the audience of the argument presented. 
        Logo
        Using a non coloured shield shaped logo is aligned with the overall theme and since it isn’t the most commonly seen version of the logo I’d score it a -0.5.
        This is beneficial in reinforcing the power of the police and authority that comes with being a PO for the NYPD as logos are known to increase credibility in persuasive images.
